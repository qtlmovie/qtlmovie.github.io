        <p>QtlMovie is a graphical front-end to ffmpeg and other media tools,
          with simplicity in mind.</p>
        <p>QtlMovie is designed to automate a reduced number of specific tasks in a
          "one-click" way without setting many parameters.</p>
        <p>These tasks are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a simple video DVD with one movie, no menu, no alternate language.</li>
          <li>Create video files for the iPad, iPhone or Android device.</li>
          <li>Create highly compressed AVI video files.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>QtlMovie main features are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Take any type of common audio/video file as input, including DVD media.</li>
          <li>Produce DVD ISO images and optionally burn them.</li>
          <li>Produce video files for iPad, iPhone or Android viewing.</li>
          <li>Produce AVI video files for storage or interchange.</li>
          <li>Keep only one audio track.</li>
          <li>Optionally hardcode ("<i>burn</i>") one subtitle track into the video
            but does not keep subtitles as a separate stream.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>QtlMovie is based on the Qt framework. It works on Windows, Mac, Linux and should
          work on any platform which is supported by Qt version 5.5 or higher. QtlMovie uses external free software
          such as ffmpeg, DVD Author, CCExtractor or mkisofs which are available on Windows, Mac and Linux.</p>
        <p>QtlMovie is available either as source code or binary installer for Windows, Mac, Fedora and Ubuntu.
          The binary installers for Windows and Mac come prepackaged with Qt5 libraries and all required media tools.
          They are self-sufficient and do not depend on any prior installation.
          The binary packages for Fedora and Ubuntu rely on the system package dependency management
          to install the required Qt environment and media tools.
          Some very specific media tools such as CCExtractor have no standard binary packages
          for Fedora and Ubuntu. In this case, the corresponding custom packages are provided on
          the QtlMovie distribution site.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="infiles"><h2>Input files</h2></div>

        <p>When a file is open, all available video, audio and subtitle streams are displayed
          using a compact grid of radio buttons which allow the selection of the output streams.
          Each stream button displays only the most important selection criteria such as video size,
          languages or properties like "for visual/hearing impaired".</p>
        <p><strong>Hint:</strong> Each stream button has a "tooltip" feature which gives more details
          on the stream such as the encoding, bitrate or metadata. Simply move the mouse over
          the button to get more details. You may also have a precise technical description
          of all streams using the <a href="#fileprop">Input file properties</a> dialog.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="avin"><h3>Audio/video input</h3></div>

        <p>Input files can be any type of multimedia file which is accepted as input by ffmpeg.
          This include the container file format (MPG, AVI, MKV, TS, M2TS, etc.), the video format
          (MPEG-2, AVC / H.264, WMV, etc.) and the audio format (MP2, MP3, AC-3, AAC, etc.)</p>
        <p>Multiple video, audio and subtitle streams can be present. The QtlMovie graphical interface
          requests the user to select exactly one video and one audio stream.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="subin"><h3>Subtitle input</h3></div>

        <p>At most one subtitle source can be specified. This can be a stream of the input file or an external subtitle file.</p>
        <p>The following subtitles formats are supported.
          The note <sup><i>[F]</i></sup> indicates that the format can also be read from an external subtitle file,
          independently of the input file. All other subtitle formats must be present in the input file.
          The note <sup><i>[T]</i></sup> indicates that the subtitle format can be used only in MPEG transport
          stream files (TS or M2TS).
          The note <sup><i>[E]</i></sup> indicates that the subtitle format is
          <a href="#subout">extractible as SRT</a> by QtlMovie.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>SubRip (SRT) <sup><i>[F]</i></sup> <sup><i>[E]</i></sup>.</li>
          <li>SubStation Alpha (SSA, ASS) <sup><i>[F]</i></sup> <sup><i>[E]</i></sup>.</li>
          <li>DVD subtitles.</li>
          <li>DVB subtitles <sup><i>[T]</i></sup>.</li>
          <li>Teletext subtitles <sup><i>[T]</i></sup> <sup><i>[E]</i></sup>.</li>
          <li>Closed Captions (US CEA-608/708) <sup><i>[E]</i></sup>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Important: The subtitles are always hardcoded ("<i>burnt</i>") into the video by QtlMovie.
          The output file never contains independent subtitle streams.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="dvdin"><h3>DVD input</h3></div>

        <p>QtlMovie is ideal to rip DVD and create iPad/iPhone/Android movies, a typical task when you own
          an iPad and many DVD's.</p>
        <p>A DVD is a standard file system. All video contents are in a top-level directory named VIDEO_TS.
          Inside VIDEO_TS, there are several <i>title sets</i>.
          A title set is typically a film, a documentary, a bonus, etc.
          Title sets are numbered from "00" to "99" (potentially).
          The title set "nn" is composed of several files named
          VTS_nn_0.IFO, VTS_nn_0.VOB (optional), VTS_nn_1.VOB, etc.
          The video content starts in VTS_nn_1.VOB and extends to other VOB's.
          The optional VTS_nn_0.VOB is typically an introduction and is not part of the film.
          Each VOB has a maximum size of 1 GB.
          Finding the main film of the DVD is usually easy, this is the largest video content (sum of all
          the VTS_nn_*.VOB).</p>
        <p>QtlMovie recognizes this structure. To transcode a film, simply select as input file the
          information file VTS_nn_0.IFO or any VTS_nn_*.VOB. QtlMovie will automatically find all VOB's for
          the film. QtlMovie also automatically finds the associated information file VTS_nn_0.IFO.
          This is an important file since it contains the language names of the audio and subtitle tracks
          and the color palette of the subtitles. When ripping a DVD, do not forget to include the .IFO
          file for the film. Otherwise, the audio and subtitle tracks will appear without language and
          you will be unable to decide which one to select. Also, without the .IFO file, the subtitles
          appear in dirty colors and are barely watchable.</p>
        <p>QtlMovie can work directly on the DVD medium since this is a regular file system.
          Copy-protected DVD's are automatically decrypted on the fly upstream from the transcoding process.</p>
        <p><b>Warnings:</b> A DVD reader is a slow device. When selecting a file on a DVD medium, the various
          audio and subtitle tracks may not appear immediately. FFmpeg discovers audio and subtitle tracks
          only when they appear. When an input file is selected, ffprobe reads the beginning of the file until
          all tracks are found. On a hard disk, this is a very fast operation. But on a DVD drive, subtitle
          tracks usually appear several minutes of playback after the beginning of the movie and it may take up to one
          minute to discover them in QtlMovie on a slow DVD reader.</p>
        <p>Also pay attention to a weird behavior of ffmpeg on some DVD's. When the movie is long, typically
          two hours or more, the DVD is "dual-layered". Half of the VOB files are on one layer and the other
          half is on the other layer. It has been noted that the time stamps of the video restart at zero
          at the beginning of the second layer. This creates some problems with ffmpeg.
          In fact, the transcoding is done correctly but the way ffmpeg behaves can be disconcerting.
          Either in the middle (ripped files on hard drive) or at the end of the movie (files on DVD),
          QtlMovie appears to freeze.
          In fact, it does not.
          FFmpeg continues the transcoding but no longer reports its progress.
          This is why the transcoding <i>appears</i> to freeze.
          But do not interrupt the transcoding.
          After several minutes, up to 40 minutes in some cases,
          ffmpeg restarts the reporting of its progress and the transcoding continues normally.
          During the period of pseudo-freeze, the memory space of ffmpeg increases, possibly up to 3 GB.
          Then, the memory space of ffmpeg gradually decreases back to its original size.
          This may cause some trouble on computers with a small memory. In case of problem, you may try
          to increase the size of the paging file or swap partition. You may also try to first extract the
          files from the DVD and retry the transcoding from a hard disk.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="outfiles"><h2>Output files</h2></div>

        <div class="anchor" id="dvdout"><h3>DVD output</h3></div>

        <p>QtlMovie always produces DVD with the following characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>PAL (720 x 576, 25 frames/second) or NTSC (720 x 480, 30 frames/second) format.</li>
          <li>MPEG-2 video, 16:9. The average bitrate is 4 Mb/s
            (adjustable in the settings) but is automatically reduced when necessary so
            that the output fits in a 4.7 GB DVD media.</li>
          <li>AC-3 audio (aka Dolby Digital), stereo, sampled at 48 kHz. The audio bitrate is 192 kb/s.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The output video has a 16:9 aspect ratio. Black borders are added when necessary so
          that the meaningful image part has the same aspect ratio as the input file.</p>
        <p>QtlMovie can produce several types of DVD output:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An MPEG file (.mpg) with a DVD-compliant content.</li>
          <li>An ISO image of the DVD media.</li>
          <li>Burn the DVD media.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first option can be used to check the resulting audio/video using standard media players.
          If the result is satisfactory, the resulting MPEG file can be used as input to produce a DVD ISO image.</p>
        <p>When producing a DVD ISO image, QtlMovie tries to guess if the input file is already
          a DVD-compliant MPEG file or not. In the first case, QtlMovie does not re-encode the
          input file and directly creates the DVD structure from the input MPEG file.
          If the input file is not fully DVD-compliant but its video stream is DVD-compliant,
          the video is not transcoded to save time and QtlMovie performs the audio transcoding and
          remux only.</p>
        <p>A DVD ISO image can also be used as input file. In this case, the only possible
          output type is burning the image to a physical medium.</p>
        <p>A consequence of these features is that a DVD can be created either at once, from the orginal
          video file to the DVD physical medium, or in several phases. In the later case, the output
          of a phase (MPEG file, ISO image) can be used as input for the next phase without the pain
          of audio/video re-encoding.</p>
        <p>When the output type type is burning to a physical media, the so-called <i>output file name</i>
          designates the ISO image in fact. The default DVD burning device shall be selected in the settings menu.
          The ISO image is never deleted and can be reused to burn additional media.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="dvdouttv"><h4>Creating a DVD from a TV recording</h4></div>

        <p>When creating a DVD from a TV recording, some editing is usually required. Typically, there is some
          extra content to delete at the beginning and end. If the recorded program contains ads, you may want
          to delete them also.</p>
        <p>QtlMovie is not a video editor and you need an external tool to remove the unwanted
          parts of the movie file. Open-source tools such as AviDemux or Virtual Dub can do that.</p>
        <p>You should use one of these tools to <i>edit</i> the video (namely cut the unwanted parts) but not re-encode it.
          With tools like AviDemux, explicitely select the <i>copy</i> option for video and audio tracks
          to avoid re-encoding. If you use AviDemux on Windows, we recommend the version 2.5.6 (32-bit).
          Although outdated, this version cuts MPEG-2 videos without errors while more recent versions
          are subject to irritating crashes.</p>
        <p>You also have to pay attention to one point.
          If the original file contains a subtitle stream you want to use, you should not edit the original video file.
          It may depend on the editing tool, but most of the time the subtitle streams are lost after editing.
          Instead, you should use the following scenario:</p>
        <ul class="qtl-topics">
          <li>Use QtlMovie to generate a <i>DVD MPEG File</i> with the complete content.
            Select the required audio and subtitle streams.
            This is the longest part, where the re-encoding takes place.</li>
          <li>Edit this MPEG file and cut the unwanted parts.
            Save the result as MPEG file without re-encoding. This is usually fast.</li>
          <li>Use QtlMovie again to open the edited MPEG file and create the DVD from it.
            This is also usually fast since QtlMovie recognizes the MPEG file as being
            DVD-compliant and does not perform any re-encoding.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This method is always the preferred one, even if the input file is simple and
          contains only one video, one audio track and no subtitle. It is more
          reliable and more robust to edit an MPEG-2 video file than most other formats.
          Editing a video file without re-encoding requires to cut on intra-frames only
          and MPEG-2 files are easier to edit than AVC / H.264 for instance.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="ipadout"><h3>iPad output</h3></div>

        <p>QtlMovie always produces iPad files with the following characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>MP4 file format.</li>
          <li>MPEG-4 part 10 / AVC / H.264 video, baseline profile, level 3.0.
            The frame rate is 30 frames per second.
            The display aspect ratio is unchanged (no black border is added).
            The frame size is unchanged, unless the input size exceeds the iPad native screen resolution in
            which case the size is reduced to fit within this resolution, preserving the input aspect ratio.</li>
          <li>AAC audio, stereo, sampled at 48 kHz. The audio bitrate is 160 kb/s.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The video bitrate is based on a <i>video quality indicator</i> which is defined in
          the settings for iPad. This quality indicator is set in bits per pixel per 100 frames.
          The actual bitrate is computed according to the actual output frame size and this
          video quality indicator. The default video quality for iPad is 11 bits / pixel / 100 frames,
          giving a bitrate of 2.6 Mb/s for a full-size iPad 2 video (1024x768).</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="iphoneout"><h3>iPhone output</h3></div>

        <p>QtlMovie always produces iPhone files with the following characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>MP4 file format.</li>

        <div class="anchor" id="subout"><h3>Subtitle extraction</h3></div>

        <p>QtlMovie can also be used to extract subtitle streams from the input files.
          The subtitle format must be text (SRT, SSA, ASS, Teletext or Closed Captions).
          Bitmap subtitles such as DVD or DVB subtitles cannot currently be extracted.
          The output subtitle file format is SRT.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="forcedar"><h3>Forcing the display aspect ratio</h3></div>

        <p>A common problem in video files is the setting of an incorrect display aspect ratio.
          For instance, you may get a file which is marked with a 4:3 aspect ratio but, when you
          play it, the image looks compressed. It is probable that the original format was
          16:9 but, for some reason, was incorrectly marked as 4:3. When converting this
          type of video, it is useful to force QtlMovie to use the correct aspect ratio.</p>
        <p>This is the purpose of the "Force display aspect ratio" option. When it is checked,
          the manually entered aspect ratio is used instead of the one from the input file.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="batchmode"><h2>Single-file mode vs. multi-file batch mode</h2></div>

        <p>By default, QtlMovie transcodes one file at a time. The main window contains all
          information for one transcoding in an easy one-click way. This is the default
          "single-file mode". To transcode a second movie, the user has to wait for the
          completion of the first one.</p>
        <p>When a batch of several files need to be transcoded, the total conversion process
          may take hours and it is not convenient for the user to wait for the completion
          of each transcoding. For this kind of situation, QtlMovie has a "multi-file batch mode"
          which allows the processing of multiple files in sequence. The main window shows
          a list of files to be processed. The transcoding operation processes all files in
          the list automatically. Adding other files to process is allowed during the transcoding
          of the previous files.</p>
        <p>To add several files at a time in multi-file batch mode, simply drag and drop files
          into the file list windows.</p>
        <p>To switch between "single-file mode" and "multi-file batch mode", use the switch
          option in the "Tools" menu. Note that switching mode requires the application to
          restart. You may also set the preferred mode in the <a href="#tabMisc">settings</a>.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="miscfeat"><h2>Miscellaneous features</h2></div>

        <div class="anchor" id="logwin"><h3>The log window</h3></div>

        <p>The log window is the bottom part of the QtlMovie main window.
          All external commands are displayed there, with their output and error messages.
          This is mainly a debug feature which can be ignored by most users.</p>
        <p>Using the "Tools" menu, the log window can be cleared or saved in a text file.
          There is also a "Log Debug" option which activates more debug traces in the log window.
          When reporting a problem about QtlMovie, it is a good idea to clear the log window,
          activate the debug, perform the operations which exhibit the problem, save the log
          into a text file and attach this text file to the problem report.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="fileprop"><h3>Input file properties</h3></div>

        <p>The "Input File Properties" option in the "Tools" menu displays all properties of
          the input file as reported by <i>ffprobe</i>.
          This provides a more precise view of the file and its streams but requires some
          knownledge about FFmpeg.</p>
        <p>In <a href="#batchmode">multi-file batch mode</a>, the "Input File Properties"
          option is not in the "Tools" menu since there are possibly more than one input
          file. Instead, use the "Properties" button in the task editor.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="audiotest"><h3>Audio test</h3></div>

        <p>The "Test Audio" option in the "Tools" menu opens a dialog box for testing the
          audio streams in the input file. This is useful when the languages of the audio
          tracks are not correctly identified in the input file. Using this dialog box,
          the user can select and play the various audio tracks in order to recognize the
          language of each track.</p>
        <p>In <a href="#batchmode">multi-file batch mode</a>, the "Test Audio" option is
          not in the "Tools" menu since there are possibly more than one input file.
          Instead, use the "Test Audio" button in the task editor.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="dvdextract"><h3>DVD extraction</h3></div>

        <p>The "DVD extraction" option in the "Tools" menu opens an independent application
          for extracting the content of copy-protected DVD's. This is an independent tool
          which is not required to transcode DVD's. Since version 1.9, QtlMovie can directly
          transcode the content of copy-protected DVD's without initially ripping the DVD
          and transfering its content on a hard drive.</p>
        <p>All currently mounted DVD's are listed in the combox box "Input DVD".
          The first one is automatically selected. If DVD media are ejected or inserted
          in the meantime, press "Refresh" to update the content of the window.</p>
        <p>The "DVD extraction" tool has three tabs, one per mode of operation.
          In all cases, the output files are created in the selected "Destination directory".</p>
        <ul class="qtl-topics">
          <li>Tab "ISO": When this tab is selected, the complete content of the DVD is
            extracted as one large ISO file.</li>
          <li>Tab "Video Title Sets" (or VTS): When this tab is selected, each VTS in the
            DVD can be selectively extracted. When a VTS is selected, all its main files
            are extracted, that is VTS_nn_0.IFO, VTS_nn_1.VOB and following.
            See the topic <a href="#dvdin">"DVD input"</a> for an explanation of title sets.</li>
          <li>Tab "Files": When this tab is selected, each file in the DVD can be selectively extracted.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="anchor" id="settings"><h2>Settings and options</h2></div>

        <p>The QtlMovie settings are accessible using the "Tools" menu.</p>
        <p>On Mac, the settings are accessible using the "Preferences" entry in the "QtlMovie" application menu.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="tabDirectories"><h3>"Directories" tab</h3></div>

        <p>The "Default input directory" is where the "Browse" button is initially set when no input
          file is currently selected. By default, this is the user's home directory.</p>
        <p>The "Default output directory" area defines where the output file shall be
          created by default. The default output file name inside the output directory is
          the same as the input file with the extension corresponding to the output file type.</p>
        <p>If the option "Same as input directory" is checked, the default location for the output
          file is the same as the input file. Otherwise, a specific directory can be selected for
          each output type.</p>
        <p>The default output directory for DVD extraction is used by the tool <a href="#dvdextract">"DVD Extraction"</a>
          only. If can never be the same as input directory since in that case the input is a DVD
          which is read-only by definition.</p>
        <p>The "DVD burning device" designates the device name for the DVD burner.
          On Windows, it shall be a device letter like "D:" or "E:".
          On Unix systems, it shall be a device path such as "/dev/dvd".
          Unlike input and output directories, this is not a default value which can be changed in the GUI,
          this is the actual device name which is unconditionally used when "Burn DVD" is selected as output type.
          This makes sense since most computers have only one DVD drive.
          Note that the default output directory for type "Burn DVD" is not the burning device, this is the
          directory where the ISO image files are stored before burning. There are two different default
          output directories for output types "DVD ISO Image" and "Burn DVD" since images of the later type
          are typically created in a temporary directory that the user wants to clean up on a regular basis.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="tabTools"><h3>"Media Tools" tab</h3></div>

        <p>This tab specifies the location of the executable files for the external media tools which are used by QtlMovie:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>FFmpeg</li>
          <li>FFprobe</li>
          <li>DVD Author</li>
          <li>mkisofs</li>
          <li>growisofs</li>
          <li>CCExtractor</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For each tool, the "Default" value is the location where QtlMovie has found the corresponding executable.
          The way QtlMovie locates the media tools depends on the operating system.
          On Windows and Mac, they are searched first in the <i>wintools</i> or <i>mactools</i>
          subdirectories inside the QtlMovie
          installation area, then in various predefined locations for each tool (typically within
          <i>C:\Program Files</i> on Windows) and finally in the <i>PATH</i> environment variable.
          On other Unix systems, the media tools are searched in the <i>PATH</i> environment variable.</p>
        <p>For each tool, a specific alternate executable can be selected in the corresponding edit box
          or using the corresponding "Browse" button.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="tabTranscoding"><h3>"Transcoding" tab</h3></div>

        <p>This tab groups all the settings which affect the audio and video transcoding.</p>
        <p>The "Transcoding duration" indicates whether the entire input file shall be transcoded
          or if the output file shall be truncated after a given number of seconds.
          Note that this indicates the playout duration of the output file,
          not the duration of the transcoding operation.
          Trancoding a movie can take a long time and limiting the transcoded duration can be helpful
          in a test phase, to verify the video quality or the audio or subtitle language for instance.</p>
        <p>The "Default output type" applies to all new tasks. The actual output type of a task
          can be manually modified.</p>
        <p>The "Video transformation" area is used for the common video transformation operations.
          When the option "Rotate video based on input metadata" is checked, the orientation
          of the output video is automatically modified based on the "rotate" metadata in the
          input file. This is useful for video files which were shot using an iPhone or other
          Apple devices. The iPhone orientation (portrait, landscape, upside-down, etc) is
          stored in private metadata but the video file has a fixed orientation. Such video files
          are correctly played on Apple video players such as QuickTime but not on standard video
          players. This option fixes this.</p>
        <p>The "Keep intermediate files" option indicates that all intermediate files which were created
          in the transcoding process shall not be deleted after completion.
          These files are created in a temporary directory with the same name as the output file and
          extension <i>.qtlmovie.temp</i>.
          This option is usually reserved for debug purpose.</p>
        <p>The "FFmpeg options" specify additional options which are specific to FFmpeg.
          The "initial probe size" is the amount of seconds which are analyzed at the beginning of
          the input file to determine the number and type of audio, video and subtitle streams.
          The FFmpeg default value is 5 seconds. This is usually enough for most files.
          However, some MPEG files do not list all their streams at the beginning of the file and
          some streams which appear late in the file (subtitles for instance) may not be detected.
          As a consequence, the default probe size for QtlMovie is 200 seconds.
          It is recommended to not reduce this size.
          It can be increased if you suspect that some streams are not detected.</p>
        <p>The "FFprobe timeout" is the maximum duration of the execution of FFprobe.
          FFprobe is used when an input file is selected to determine the number and types of streams.
          This option may need to be inscreased when the input file is on a slow DVD drive.</p>
        <p>The "Play sound on completion" option indicates that a sound will be played
          each time a transcoding process completes.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="tabDvd"><h3>"DVD" tab</h3></div>

        <p>This tab is divided into two groups.
          The first group of settings contains those which are used when reading DVD content as input.
          The second group contains those which affect the generation of DVD's.</p>
        <p>In the group of settings for reading DVD content, checking the option "Transcode raw VOB files"
          means that FFmpeg will transcode the raw content of all VOB files for a given movie
          (or "VTS", for "Video Title Set"). This will work for most movies.
          However, some DVD's have movies with more than one "Program Chain" (PGC) or more than one "Angle".
          In this case, the various program chains and angles are multiplexed inside the VOB files
          and FFmpeg is unable to differentiate them. The result of the transcoding is consequently
          inconsistent. This is why this option is disabled by default.</p>
        <p>When the option "Demultiplex one specific Program Chain" is enabled, QtlMovie will demultiplex the content of the VOB
          files and provide to FFmpeg only the specified "PGC" and "Angle".
          PGC's and angles are numbered starting from 1 onward.
          The default values 1 and 1 are recommended since they usually refer to the standard playback of the movie.
          If the specified PGC does not exist, the PGC number 1 will always be used instead.</p>
        <p>In the group of settings for the generation of DVD's,
          the PAL vs. NTSC options indicate the format of all created DVD's.</p>
        <p>The specified video bitrate is used by default as "average bitrate".
          However, QtlMovie ensures that the output can fit into a standard 4.7 GB DVD medium
          and reduces the bitrate accordingly when necessary.</p>
        <p>When checked, the "Create chapters" option creates chapters on the DVD.
          All chapters have the same specified number of minutes.</p>
        <p>When checked, the option "Remux audio/video after transcode" forces an additional remuxing of
          the audio and video after transcoding. This takes some additional time but this removes potential
          synchronization errors with DVD Author when the DVD file structure is created.
          This also enforces a DVD-compliant multiplexing when the input file already has DVD-compliant
          audio and video and is not re-encoded.
          It is recommended to let this option checked.</p>
        <p>The option "Force transcoding even if the input file or video is DVD-compliant"
          does what it says... This can be useful to force a transcoding when the
          file seems DVD-compliant but is not really (too large for instance).</p>
        <p>When the option "Set burning speed" is checked, the DVD burning speed is
          forced to the corresponding value (with "1x" being the nominal DVD transfer
          rate: 1.385 MB/s). This speed is directly passed to <i>growisofs</i>.
          When the option is not checked, the DVD burning speed is not changed.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="tabIpad"><h3>"iPad" tab</h3></div>

        <p>This tab groups all the settings which affect the generation of video files for the iPad.</p>
        <p>The "Screen size" options specify the type of iPad to target.
          The corresponding screen resolution will be used as maximum video size.
          Larger videos will be resized to fit within the selected iPad resolution.</p>
        <p>The "Video quality" option, in bits per pixel per 100 frames, is explained in
          the section about <a href="#ipadout">iPad output</a>. For information, the corresponding

        <p>This tab groups all the settings which affect the generation of AVI files.</p>
        <p>The "Max size" options specify the maximum resolution of the output video.
          Larger videos will be resized to fit within this resolution.</p>
        <p>The "Video quality" option, in bits per pixel per 100 frames, is explained in
          the section about <a href="#ipadout">iPad output</a>. For information, the corresponding
          maximum video bitrate for the selected maximum resolution is also displayed.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="tabAudio"><h3>"Audio" tab</h3></div>

        <p>This tab groups all the settings which affect the audio transcoding.
          Note that most audio transcoding options like bit rate, sample rate or number of channels
          are fixed to the appropriate value for a given target (DVD, iPad, iPhone, Android, AVI) and cannot be modified.</p>
        <p>When the option "Normalize audio level" is checked, QtlMovie performs audio
          normalization on the transcoded audio track. This adds an initial pass on the file
          to determine the input audio level. The corresponding audio normalization it then
          performed in the general transcoding passes.</p>
        <p>The "Mean level" option specifies the target mean audio level after normalization.
          The level -20 dBFS is commonly used for cinema. Pop/rock concerts may be raised
          to -12 dBFS but higher values (closer to zero) may compress the dynamics too much.
          Be aware that the target level is only an approximated value. The actual output
          audio level can vary in the range +1/-1 dB depending the target transcoding type.
          The "Max peak level" option specifies the maximum audio peak level after normalization.
          In theory, 0 dBFS is ideal but -1 dBFS should be preferred to avoid clipping.</p>
        <p>When the input dynamic is too large for the target normalization, several options
          are possible.</p>
        <ul class="qtl-topics">
          <li>Align to mean level and compress: The target mean level is used and dynamic
            compression is performed (similar to standard MP3 conversions).
            This is the default and should be fine for most usages.</li>
          <li>Align to peak level: No compression or distortion is introduced but the actual mean
            level will be lower than the specified target mean level. This may be preferred to
            keep a high fidelity. But remember that the audio is compressed anyway so there
            is no real "high fidelity".</li>
          <li>Align to mean level level and clip: The target mean level is used and no
            compression is performed. But the highest sounds are clipped and this may
            introduced nasty sound effects.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="anchor" id="tabSubtitles"><h3>"Subtitles" tab</h3></div>

        <p>This tab groups all the settings which affect the processing of subtitles.</p>
        <p>The option "Cleanup SRT/SSA/ASS files before insertion" is used to remove
          all invalid nul characters from the subtitles files. It has been observed
          that some MKV files had ASS subtitles using metadata containing
          a trailing nul character. This invalid character broke <i>ffmpeg</i> and the
          subtitles were not burned into the video. Checking this option fixes this issue.</p>
        <p>The option "Downgrade SSA/ASS subtitles to SRT" is used to force a conversion
          of SubStation Alpha subtitles (SSA/ASS) to SubRip (SRT) before burning them
          in the video. This can be useful to remove the formatting of SSA/ASS subtitles
          when their presentation is too weird.</p>
        <p>When converting SSA/ASS subtitles to SRT, the option "Use HTML tags in SRT subtitles"
          is used to replicate some basic formatting from the SSA/ASS subtitles into SRT using HTML tags.
          However, the HTML tags are defined as an extension of the SRT format and are not
          supported by all tools. Uncheck this option to prevent the use of HTML tags in the
          generated SRT subtitles. FFmpeg correctly interprets HTML tags in SRT, so you should
          leave this option activated unless you need the extracted SRT files for some other
          usage.</p>
        <p>Some US TV channels broadcast all Closed Captions in UPPERCASE.
          If you find that annoying, check the option "Capitalize US Closed Captions".
          This option is directly passed to <i>CCExtractor</i> which formats the subtitles
          in a nicer looking way.</p>
        <p>The option "Use original video size as a hint for SRT/SSA/ASS character shape" is somewhat cryptic.
          If checked, the original size of the video is used to alter the character size of text-based subtitles
          so that the subtitles are scaled the same way as the video.
          This means that, if you convert an HD content to DVD, significantly reducing the video size,
          the subtitles will appear much smaller than on a normal DVD.
          This is why it is unchecked by default.
          You may try to check it and decide whether it is useful or not.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="tabMisc"><h3>"Miscellaneous" tab</h3></div>

        <p>As the name implies, this tab groups all options which did not fit in other tabs.</p>
        <p>The "File processing mode" options describe how QtlMovie processes multiple input
          files. Since these options significantly modifies the way QtlMovie works, they are
          actually applied only when QtlMovie is restarted.</p>
        <ul class="qtl-topics">
          <li>The "single file mode" is the legacy mode which was found in the original version
            of QtlMovie. Only one file can be processed at a time. This is a simple operation
            mode. The input and output file descriptions directly appear in the main window.</li>
          <li>The "<a href="#batchmode">multi-file batch mode</a>" allows the processing of
            multiple files in sequence. The main window shows a list of files to be processed.
            The transcoding operation processes all files in the list. Adding other files to
            process is allowed during the transcoding of the previous files.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The "Target audience language codes" lists the codes which are used to identify the
          language of the "target audience".
          This needs some explanation.
          When an input file is opened, QtlMovie displays all audio and subtitle tracks
          which are available in the file.
          But, by default, it also pre-selects the tracks which should be most likely adequate for the user
          (or "target audience").
          QtlMovie makes the assumption that the user prefers to watch the film in original version
          with subtitles in his own language but this behavior can be disabled.
          The initial default stream selection is performed as follow:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Default audio stream selection:
            <ul>
              <li>Try to determine the "original version" stream if one is flagged as such.</li>
              <li>If not possible, keep the first audio track not matching any language in the
                intended audience language codes (supposed to be the original audio, considering
                any audience language as dubbing).</li>
              <li>Otherwise, keep first audio without visual impaired indicator.</li>
              <li>This behavior can be disabled by unchecking the option
                "Automatically select the original audio track".</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Default subtitle stream selection:
            <ul>
              <li>In all cases, consider only the subtitles in the intended audience language codes.
                If the list of target audience languages is empty, there will be no default subtitle.
                Within the various subtitles in the audience language codes, the following criteria apply.</li>
              <li>If the audio stream is in the audience language codes, keep the first "forced"
                subtitle (the "forced" subtitle are used only when the audio track of the same
                language contains dialogues in another language).</li>
              <li>If the audio stream is not in the audience language codes, keep the subtitles which are either
                (in order of preference)
                <ul>
                  <li>complete</li>
                  <li>for hearing impaired</li>
                  <li>other</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>This behavior can be disabled by unchecking the option
                "Automatically select the subtitles for the target audience language".</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the group "DVD extraction", the option "Recreate directory tree when extracting DVD"
          is used when extracting files and Video Title Sets (VTS) from a DVD using the tool
          <a href="#dvdextract">"DVD Extraction"</a>. When this option is set, the directory structure of the DVD is recreated
          under the output directory. Otherwise, all files are directly extracted in the output directory.</p>
        <p>The option "Use DVD maximum read speed" is used to configure the DVD reader to
          maximum speed for all types of extractions. Generally, this speeds up the extraction.
          But this may also create read errors. Note that this option is not supported on all drives.</p>
        <p>The "Max log" option indicates the number of text lines to retain in the log window.
          When this threshold is reached, the first lines are deleted.
          When "Clear log before transcoding" is checked, the log window is automatically cleared
          before starting a transcoding operation. This option is useful when "Save log after transcoding"
          is checked, meaning that the log is automatically saved as a text file when any
          transcoding operation completes. The saved log file has the same name as the output
          file with extension <i>.log</i>.</p>
        <p>The option "Automatically search for a new version at startup" indicates if a new
          version of QtlMovie is searched online each time the application starts. When disabled, it
          is possible to manually search for a new version using the menu "Help" / "Search New Version".</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="cmdline"><h2>Command line syntax</h2></div>

        <p>QtlMovie is normally started from the desktop menu without command line argument.
          This is sufficient for normal usage.</p>
        <p>However, a few options can be provided on the command line.
          The syntax is the following:</p>
        <div class="w3-code">
          <p>QtlMovie [-l <i>locale</i>] [-d] [-e] [<i>inputfile ...</i>]</p>
        </div>
        <p>The <i>locale</i> specifies an alternate locale such as "en" or "fr_FR".
          By default, the system locale is used.</p>
        <p>The option "-d" activates the debug messages in the log. This is equivalent
          to the menu entry "Tools" => "Log Debug".</p>
        <p>The option "-e" directly opens the <a href="#dvdextract">"DVD Extraction"</a> tool, without the standard
          QtlMovie main window. This is equivalent to the menu entry "Tools" => "DVD Extraction"
          followed by "File" => "Quit".</p>
        <p>The <i>inputfile ...</i> specifies video input files which are automatically open
          when QtlMovie starts. Specifying more that one input is useful only in
          <a href="#batchmode">multi-file batch mode</a>.</p>
        <p>Example: If your system's locale is supported by QtlMovie but you are not
          satisfied by the translations, you can revert to English by editing the QtlMovie
          command in the desktop menus as follow:</p>
        <div class="w3-code">
          <p>QtlMovie -l en</p>
        </div>

        <div class="anchor" id="platforms"><h2>Platforms notes</h2></div>

        <div class="anchor" id="windows"><h3>Windows</h3></div>

        <p>QtlMovie is primarily developed on Windows. The binary installer for QtlMovie includes
          all required media tools. Running the QtlMovie binary installer is sufficient to get
          a fully functional system.</p>
        <p>The media tools are installed in the same directory tree as QtlMovie but you may
          select alternate versions of these tools in the settings menu.</p>
        <p>There is one binary installer for 32-bit systems and another one for 64-bit systems.
          However, the 64-bit installer mostly contains 32-bit executables. FFmpeg is the only
          64-bit executable in the installer. There is no performance advantage in using 64-bit
          executables for all other tools, including QtlMovie itself.</p>
        <p>The binary installers require administration privileges to install QtlMovie
          on the system. For users without such privileges, use the "standalone"
          archive. Unzip it anywhere at simply run QtlMovie.exe.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="macosx"><h3>Mac OS X</h3></div>

        <p>QtlMovie has been tested on Mac OS X 10.11 ("El Capitan") and proved to work correctly.</p>
        <p>The package QtlMovie-<i>version</i>.dmg is installed the same way as most Mac
          applications. Double-click on the .dmg file to open the disk image. In
          the Finder window which is opened, drag and drop "QtlMovie" into
          "Applications". Then, close the Finder windows, right-click on the
          desktop icon for "QtlMovie" and select "Eject". Now QtlMovie can be
          started from the Launcher and optionally locked on the Dock.</p>
        <p>The media tools are installed in the same directory tree as QtlMovie but you may
          select alternate versions of these tools in the settings menu.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="linux"><h3>Linux</h3></div>

        <p>QtlMovie has been tested on Fedora and Ubuntu Linux systems and proved to work correctly.</p>
        <p>FFmpeg needs to be available in version 1.2 or higher. On several systems, the standard version
          of FFmpeg which comes with the distro repositories is outdated and a more recent version may be needed.
          Mkisofs shall be used with version 2, the version 3 has proven to be broken.
          There is usually no distro packaging for CCExtractor and you need to
          download them from the QtlMovie download area (see below).</p>
        <p>All media tools are searched by QtlMovie in <i>$PATH</i>.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="fedora"><h4>Fedora and Red Hat Entreprise Linux</h4></div>

        <p>Binary RPM packages for Fedora on x86_64 architecture are available on the 
          <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/qtlmovie/files/fedora/">QtlMovie distribution size for Fedora on SourceForge</a>
          for QtlMovie and CCExtractor.</p>
        <p>The package <i>ffmpeg</i> is available through the RPMfusion repository, not the standard Fedora repositories.
          See <a href="http://rpmfusion.org/Configuration">rpmfusion.org</a> for the way to configure RPMfusion as
          a default repository for your system.</p>

        <div class="anchor" id="ubuntu"><h4>Ubuntu and Debian</h4></div>

        <p>Binary DEB packages for Ubuntu on amd64 architecture are available on the 
          <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/qtlmovie/files/ubuntu/">QtlMovie distribution site for Ubuntu on SourceForge</a>
          for QtlMovie and CCExtractor.</p>
        <p>On Ubuntu version 15 and higher, the package <i>ffmpeg</i> is available from the standard Ubuntu repositories.</p>
        <p>On older versions of Ubuntu, FFmpeg is not directly available.
          At some point, for various reasons, Ubuntu decided to drop FFmpeg from their
          repositories. Instead, Ubuntu provided <i>avconv</i> (package <i>libav-tools</i>),
          a fork from FFmpeg. However, the commands <i>avconv</i> and <i>avprobe</i>
          are only partially compatible with <i>ffmpeg</i> and <i>ffprobe</i>.
          Since QtlMovie generates complex <i>ffmpeg</i> and <i>ffprobe</i> commands,
          they almost never work with <i>avconv</i> and <i>avprobe</i>.</p>
        <p>The only solution to use QtlMovie on Ubuntu prior to version 15 is to install a plain real version
          of FFmpeg. The first way is to recompile FFmpeg from the sources on Ubuntu.
          This is complex and not recommended. The second way is to use a precompiled
          version of FFmpeg for Ubuntu as described below.</p>
        <p>Non-official Ubuntu packages can be installed from a
          <i>Personal Package Archive</i> (PPA). On Ubuntu prior to version 15, FFmpeg is available from the
          <a href="https://launchpad.net/~jon-severinsson/+archive/ffmpeg">Jon Severinsson's PPA</a>.
          The following commands demonstrate how to declare this PPA on a Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty)
          system and install FFmpeg. You must be <i>root</i> to execute these commands.</p>
<pre>
add-apt-repository ppa:jon-severinsson/ffmpeg
apt-get update
apt-get install ffmpeg
</pre>

        <div class="anchor" id="otherpf"><h3>Other platforms</h3></div>

        <p>QtlMovie should compile and properly function on any other platform which is supported by
          the Qt framework version 5.5 or higher. However, QtlMovie is useless without ffmpeg.
	  You have to check the availability of ffmpeg on a platform before attempting to use QtlMovie.</p>
